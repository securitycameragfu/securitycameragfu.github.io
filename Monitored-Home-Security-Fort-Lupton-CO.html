False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur regularly enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
