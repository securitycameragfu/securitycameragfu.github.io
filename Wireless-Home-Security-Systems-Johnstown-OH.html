<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.

<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate indoors or inside your home - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's just $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for basic home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public places is good - it helps in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post crime examination is easy and capturing culprits is easy for law-enforcement officers. </p>
