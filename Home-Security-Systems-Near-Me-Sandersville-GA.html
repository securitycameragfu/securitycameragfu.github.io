<p>Add hidden cameras to your business or residence with a GO2 Video Surveillance System. Your video cameras will act as a visual deterrent, but once criminals, staff members or baby-sitters notice them they prevent. Two-way-talk is another beneficial Ring feature.

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars in most cases. To hold and recover expenses alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.
