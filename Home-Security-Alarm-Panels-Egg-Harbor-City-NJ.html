<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply would not connect. An assistance window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a concern with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>
