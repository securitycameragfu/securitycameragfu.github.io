The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the malicious assailant to tape-record these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>
