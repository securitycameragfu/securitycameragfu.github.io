<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
