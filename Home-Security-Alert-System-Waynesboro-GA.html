<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are plainly not prevented by camera - and might even be attracted to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the minimal advantages that the system might provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Years ago, all alarm required you to have a landline phone and that landline was used to link your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other alternatives.
