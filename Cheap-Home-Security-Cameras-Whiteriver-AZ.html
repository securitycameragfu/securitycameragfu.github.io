<h3>Best Home Security Monitoring in Arizona</h3>

<p>Condo associations may forbid homeowners from drilling holes in exterior walls. Locals of these homes might be much better off using a wireless security system.

<p>Security Camera Surveillance: You can choose to add a video camera and monitor to your system so you can catch thieves in the act if they do pick to get into your home. Or, you might wish to up the ante by setting up a complex closed circuit television (CCTV) which features digital recorders, multiple operators, and a number of cameras.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
