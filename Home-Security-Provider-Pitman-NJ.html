<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
