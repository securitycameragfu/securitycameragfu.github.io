<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account.

Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
