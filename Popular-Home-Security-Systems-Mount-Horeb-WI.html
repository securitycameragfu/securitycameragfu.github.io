<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smartphone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
