<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
