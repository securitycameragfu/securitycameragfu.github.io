<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

However, there were some problems with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
