The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
