Worth keeping in mind: you can also get an outdoor version (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is essentially the exact same but with a range added functions. This one has a motion-sensor and changes on a light and siren which might be a good deterrent to trespassers, plus it's certainly waterproof and has a longer cable. Otherwise, exact same idea, exact same app, still just as easy. to setup.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly.

If you want to save some cash, search for a camera with an SD card slot that allows you to tape-record video when motion or sound is found, but keep in mind to conserve your recordings every so often before they are overwritten.
