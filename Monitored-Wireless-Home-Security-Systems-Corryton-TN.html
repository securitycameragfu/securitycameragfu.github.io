<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
