<h3>Home Burglar Alarm Systems in Corte Madera CA</h3>

When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if required, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
