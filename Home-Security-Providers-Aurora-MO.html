When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
