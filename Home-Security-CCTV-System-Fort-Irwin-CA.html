<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and therefore is still the better option for lots of who are only concerned about cost. </p>
