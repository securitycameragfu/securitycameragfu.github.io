<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you think of a home security camera. The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.
