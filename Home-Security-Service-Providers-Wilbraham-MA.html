<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
