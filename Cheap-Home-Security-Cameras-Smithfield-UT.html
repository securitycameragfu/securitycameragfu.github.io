When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
