<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has identified burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick.

<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must be able to endure exposure to the elements and should carry an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP scores contain two digits that tell you simply how well the camera will hold up under many climate condition.

The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
