But the huge majority happen throughout the day when no one is home. Some intruders break glass to reach in and unlock doors and windows. However the smarter ones don't because they don't wish to leave blood DNA at the scene. They 'd rather start your door or pry open a window.</p>

Cameras let you do everything from check on your pets during the day to see what's making sounds outside in the middle of the night. Connect Interactive likewise offers extra sensors that a lot of security companies do not.
