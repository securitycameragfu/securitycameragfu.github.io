<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level authorities authorities in Washington, DC was captured utilizing cops databases to gather info on customers of a gay club.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Wireless security systems are a fantastic way to go, particularly since they are so flexible compared to a hard-wired system. Nevertheless, there are a few things you need to understand before you go out and buy one.
