<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. On top of how simple it is to get FrontPoint systems up and running, new customers can also rely on some of the most well-regarded customer assistance in the market. A peek online shows just how warm customer reception is for the company's services and items. FrontPoint has actually also been featured on several publications and has been the winner of Angie's List Super Service Award for seven years running.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is super reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
