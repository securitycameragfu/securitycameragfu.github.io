<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your windows and door sensors, motion sensing units, control board, etc. The cost totally depends on which provider you choose, but expect to pay a few hundred dollars for a basic plan--$ 200 would be thought about cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment.
