<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and setup information to make this combination work, there are only 2 choices.

The other technique is to replace and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
