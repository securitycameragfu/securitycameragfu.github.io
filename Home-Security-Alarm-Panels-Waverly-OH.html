<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are developed to protect specific, concrete properties, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to avoid being disarmed.
