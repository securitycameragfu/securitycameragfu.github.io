The creative bit is that the camera not just finds that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will likewise have a stab at identifying them too.

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
